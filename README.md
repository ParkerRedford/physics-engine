Project: A deterministic physics engine that uses an AST/DAG algorithm to create symbolic math to put everthing on the GPU for the SIMD instruction set. The CPU will still be required for some physics stuff (probably collisions) because GPUs can't do conditions well.

Timeframe: No idea. Maybe something in December.
