This experimental project is a physics engine that utilizes all of calculus, linear algebra, numerical analysis, physics (equations will be time-based and straight from the textbooks), and Vulkan to optimize our GPUs to its limits (essentially using the theories of calculus). In other words, I will use more advanced mathematics and physics, so that the equations are put onto SIMD instructions. Development will accelerate in late August or early September.

I will open source the development tools for this project and create demos, programs, and videos to showcase this project. Hopefully, some of the demos will be created by the end of the year. One demo will show millions of particles on the screen using an AMD card and a decade old laptop. Another demo will show the physics engine import an OBJ model, and apply physics on the model. A third demo will create fire, smoke, dust, and weather related simulations.
