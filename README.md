Project: An experimental physics engine that calculates everything on the GPU by flattening all equations onto the SIMD instruction set (aka. compute shaders) rather than using the SIMT instruction set (aka. Cuda).

Hopefully, some of the demos will be created by the end of the year. One demo will show millions of particles on the screen using an AMD card and a decade old laptop. Another demo will show the physics engine import an OBJ model, and apply physics on the model (converting into the proper topology first). A third demo will create fire, smoke, dust, and weather related simulations.

Stages of the project
Stage 1 (October - November): Build a function that outputs the derivative (symbolically) of a math function. Integrals might come late after learning some complex anaylsis.
Stage 2 (December): Build a numerical analysis library.
Stage 3 (Next year): Build the skeleton of the physics engine.
Stage 4 (Mid/late next year): Build demos.

It might take longer than expected because I haven't learned everything on the subject of math and physics yet.
