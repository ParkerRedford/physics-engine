This graphics library will power a physics simulation that could simulate 1-30 million particles (plus interact with them) with either an AMD, Intel, Nvidia, (or embedded) graphics card. Key takeaway: We don't need a dedicated GPU to simulate PhysX; in fact, it can be burden using this approach.

Note: I won't be open-sourcing the math nor physics portion of the project because the physics is deterministic, an ODE solver, differentiate equations symbolically, and is GPU-accelerated. My assumption is that this project is exactly what the government, defense, military, education, engineers, institutions, science, and academia would want.

I will create some demos, apps, and videos to showcase that math wins over brands.
