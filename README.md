This graphics library will power a physics simulation that could simulate 1-30 million particles (plus interact with them) with either an AMD, Intel, Nvidia, (or embedded) graphics card. Key takeaway: We don't need a dedicated GPU to simulate PhysX; in fact, PhysX with a dedicated GPU can be a burden.

I will not open-source that portion of the project because I can see it being highly valued. I will create some demos, apps, and videos to showcase my philosophy.
